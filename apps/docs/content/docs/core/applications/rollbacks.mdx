description: Learn how to rollback your application in Dokploy.

Rollbacks are a powerful feature that allows you to easily revert changes to your application. This is particularly useful when you encounter issues or want to revert to a previous version of your application.


## Requirements

1. Have a `/health` endpoint in your application.
2. Have `curl` available in your container (if you use alpine for example, it won't be installed by default).

## Steps to Rollback


Let's suppose we have a NodeJS application that has a health check route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code and running in the port 3000.

1. In your application is necessary to have a `Path` or `Health Route` to be able to achieve zero downtime deployments eg. in the case of a NodeJS app you can have a route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.
2. Go to `Advanced` Tab and go to Cluster Settings and enter to `Swarm Settings`
3. There are a couple options that you can use, in this case we will focus on `Health Check` and `Update Config`.
4. Paste this code in the health check field:
Make sure the API Route exists in your application

```json
{
  "Test": [
    "CMD",
    "curl",
    "-f",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/health"
  ],
  "Interval": 30000000000,
  "Timeout": 10000000000,
  "StartPeriod": 30000000000,
  "Retries": 3
}
```
5. Now in the `Update Config`

Now when the application is getting unhealthy response from the health check, the container will rollback to the previous version.

Paste the following code:
```json
{
  "Parallelism": 1,
  "Delay": 10000000000,
  "FailureAction": "rollback",
  "Order": "start-first"
}
```

## Rollback to a specific version

The previous steps covered Docker Swarm's automatic rollback feature. Since v0.23.0, Dokploy also supports manual rollbacks to specific deployment points, giving you more control over your application versions.

### Enabling Rollback Feature

To start saving deployment snapshots for rollbacks:

1. Navigate to your application
2. Go to **Deployments** â†’ **Rollback Settings**
3. Enable the **Rollback** option

### How it works

- **Automatic snapshots**: Every time you deploy, Dokploy creates a rollback point associated with that deployment
- **Manual rollback**: Click the **Rollback** button next to any deployment to revert to that specific version
- **Automatic cleanup**: When old deployments are deleted, their associated rollback snapshots and images are also removed to save space

### Performing a rollback

1. Go to your application's **Deployments** section
2. Find the deployment version you want to rollback to
3. Click the **Rollback** button next to that deployment
4. Confirm the rollback action

<Callout type="info">
    Having rollbacks enabled will increase storage usage, as it saves previous versions of your application. Consider your storage capacity when enabling this feature.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    **Important**: If you manually clean Docker images using commands like `docker image prune` or `docker system prune`, the rollback snapshots may be lost. Avoid cleaning Docker images if you want to preserve your rollback history.

2. Go back to `R2 Object Storage`, and select `Manage API tokens` from the select box.
3. Create a new `User API Token`, and give it a meaninful name.
4. Set `Object Read & Write` Permission.
5. (Optional) Set Specify bucket, by default it will include all buckets.
6. Create the token.

Now copy the following variables:
